# Release process

KulLang ships four things from one repository: the `kul` CLI, the `kul-lsp` language server, the VSCode extension (published to Open VSX), and the `@kullang/wasm` npm package. They release in lockstep — one tag, one pipeline, one set of coordinated artifacts.

This doc is the source of truth for how to cut a release and what the pipeline does.

## Overview

Pushing a tag of the form `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which:

1. **Verifies version coordination** — `Cargo.toml` workspace version, `editor/vscode/package.json` version, and the tag must all match. Fails fast if they don't. The `wasm-publish` job re-asserts the wasm-pack-produced npm `package.json` version against the same tag as a belt-and-braces guard.
2. **Builds `kul` for four targets** — `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. Each binary is smoke-tested with `kul --version` and `kul validate examples/03-three-generations.kul`.
3. **Builds `kul-lsp` for the same four targets**, smoke-tested with `kul-lsp --version`.
4. **Builds and publishes `@kullang/wasm`** — `wasm-pack build --target bundler`, gzipped bundle-size assertion, `npm publish --access public`, and a `kul-wasm.tar.gz` artifact for the GitHub Release.
5. **Publishes the VSCode extension** to [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/), with platform-specific `kul-lsp` binaries bundled inside the `.vsix` so end users don't need to set `kul.serverPath`. The packaged `.vsix` is also uploaded as a workflow artifact (`kul-vsix`) so the GitHub Release can attach it for upstream-VSCode users.
6. **Creates a GitHub Release** at `v<version>` with all 10 artifacts attached (8 CLI/LSP archives + 1 WASM tarball + 1 `.vsix`) and auto-generated release notes.

`build-cli`, `build-lsp`, and `wasm-publish` run in parallel after `verify`; `openvsx-publish` runs after `build-lsp` (it bundles the LSP binaries into the `.vsix`); `github-release` waits for all four (it consumes their artifacts). Total wall-clock time is dominated by the slowest matrix build.

```

```

## Cutting a release

Three files must agree on the version before tagging:

- `Cargo.toml` → `[workspace.package].version`
- `editor/vscode/package.json` → `version`
- The git tag → `v<version>` (no prefix, no suffix beyond patch)

The `verify` job in the release workflow rejects any drift, so you can't accidentally ship a misaligned release.

### Procedure

```sh
# 1. Bump versions to match.
#    For v0.1.0 the workspace and extension are already at 0.1.0 — skip ahead.
$EDITOR Cargo.toml editor/vscode/package.json

# 2. Commit and push the bump.
git commit -am "Bump version to 0.x.0"
git push origin main

# 3. (Optional) Dry-run the pipeline before tagging.
#    GitHub UI → Actions → Release → Run workflow → leave dry_run: true
#    Builds + smoke-tests every binary on every platform without publishing.

# 4. Tag and push.
git tag v0.x.0
git push origin v0.x.0
```

The pipeline runs automatically. Watch the progress at https://github.com/YashBhalodi/kul/actions.

### What "done" looks like

- GitHub Release at `https://github.com/YashBhalodi/kul/releases/tag/v0.x.0` carries 10 artifacts:
  - `kul-<target>.{tar.gz,zip}` × 4
  - `kul-lsp-<target>.{tar.gz,zip}` × 4
  - `kul-wasm.tar.gz` × 1
  - `kul-0.x.0.vsix` × 1
- Open VSX listing at `https://open-vsx.org/extension/YashBhalodi/kul` shows the new version.
- On an Open-VSX-consuming editor (VSCodium, Cursor, Windsurf, Theia/Che, Gitpod), `<editor> --install-extension YashBhalodi.kul` resolves against Open VSX, installs, and works without setting `kul.serverPath` (the extension auto-locates the right platform binary from the bundled `server/<platform>/`).
- On upstream VSCode (which talks to Microsoft Marketplace, where KulLang is intentionally not published), users install via the released `.vsix`: download `kul-0.x.0.vsix` from the GitHub Release, `code --install-extension /path/to/kul-0.x.0.vsix`. Same bundled-binary autolocation behavior.
- `npm view @kullang/wasm version` returns `0.x.0`. A clean Node project can `npm install @kullang/wasm@0.x.0` and `import { check, exportGraph, format } from '@kullang/wasm'` without further setup.

### Recommended post-publish smoke

The integration tests cover protocol correctness, but only a human catches "the squiggle color is wrong on this theme" or "the hover popover is hard to read". After a release lands:

- Open each `examples/*.kul` in real VSCode (clean profile, bundled binary).
- Exercise diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition, completion on both light and dark themes.

## One-time setup

Before the very first Open VSX publish, the Eclipse account, namespace claim, and PAT must exist. Unlike the Microsoft Marketplace, no credit-card verification is required — an Eclipse account is free.

### a. Create the Eclipse account

- https://accounts.eclipse.org → Register (or sign in)
- Email verification only; no payment, no KYC

### b. Sign in to Open VSX and accept the Publisher Agreement

- https://open-vsx.org → "Log in" → GitHub OAuth
- Profile menu → user-settings → click "Show Publisher Agreement" and accept the terms
- The GitHub identity used for OAuth must be linked to (or share an email with) the Eclipse account

### c. Generate the publishing PAT

- https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens → "Generate New Token"
- Description: anything memorable (e.g. `kul-release-ci`)
- Copy the token immediately (only shown once)

### d. Pre-claim the `YashBhalodi` namespace

The namespace name is case-sensitive — it must match `editor/vscode/package.json`'s `"publisher"` field. Open VSX does not auto-create namespaces on first publish, so this step must happen before tagging:

```sh
npx --yes ovsx create-namespace YashBhalodi --pat <token>
```

### e. Store as repo secret

```sh
gh secret set OVSX_PAT
# paste the token at the prompt
```

The publish job reads `OVSX_PAT` from secrets. Anytime the PAT expires or is rotated, repeat (c) and (e) — `ovsx publish` will start failing with a 401 until refreshed.

## Pipeline reference

### `verify`

Parses the version from the tag (or skips when triggered by `workflow_dispatch`), reads the workspace and extension versions, fails if any pair disagrees. Outputs the resolved version for downstream jobs.

### `build-cli` / `build-lsp`

Standard cross-compilation matrix. Each platform target builds in release mode with `Swatinem/rust-cache` for incremental speed. Smoke tests run on the platforms where they can — `x86_64-apple-darwin` is skipped because `macos-latest` is now ARM-based and would need Rosetta to execute.

`build-lsp` uploads two artifact sets per platform:

- An archive (`kul-lsp-<target>.{tar.gz,zip}`) for the GitHub Release.
- A raw binary under `kul-lsp-raw-<platform_dir>/` for the `openvsx-publish` job to bundle directly. This avoids re-downloading from a Release the workflow itself just produced.

### `wasm-publish`

Builds the `@kullang/wasm` package via `wasm-pack build --target bundler`, rewrites the wasm-pack-generated `package.json` `name` to `@kullang/wasm` (wasm-pack derives the npm name from the Rust crate name `kul-wasm`), asserts the gzipped `.wasm` is ≤ 1 MB, and re-asserts the npm `package.json` version equals the release version. The `pkg/` output is then staged into `kul-wasm/` and packaged as `kul-wasm.tar.gz`, uploaded as the `kul-wasm` artifact for `github-release` to attach to the public Release.

On a real publish (tag push or `dry_run: false`), the job also runs `npm publish --access public` from `crates/kul-wasm/pkg`, authenticated via the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret. A pre-flight step fails with a readable error if `NPM_TOKEN` is unset, matching the `OVSX_PAT` failure shape. On dry-run, the build and the version assertions still run — only the npm publish is skipped, so dry-runs catch breakage before tagging.

The job does not re-run `cargo test`, the Node smoke, or `tsc --noEmit` — `.github/workflows/rust.yml`'s `wasm-build` job already gates the merge to `main`, so any commit a tag points at has already passed those checks.

### `github-release`

Pulls every archive artifact, copies them into a flat directory, and creates the public Release with `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`. Release notes are auto-generated from PRs/commits since the previous release.

### `openvsx-publish`

Pulls the raw `kul-lsp` binaries, stages them under `editor/vscode/server/<platform>/`, runs `npm ci`, and packages the bundled extension via `vsce package` (no global install — invoked through `npx @vscode/vsce` from the extension's `devDependencies`-resolved transitive). The packaged `.vsix` is uploaded as a workflow artifact named `kul-vsix` so `github-release` can attach it to the public Release for upstream-VSCode users.

On a real publish (tag push or `dry_run: false`), the job then runs `npx ovsx publish kul-<version>.vsix -p $OVSX_PAT`. A pre-flight step fails with a readable error if `OVSX_PAT` is unset, matching the `NPM_TOKEN` failure shape. On dry-run, the package step and the artifact upload still run — only the OVSX publish is skipped, so dry-runs catch breakage before tagging.

The bundled `.vsix` carries all four platform binaries. Open VSX supports platform-specific extension splits via `--target`, but a single bundled `.vsix` is simpler at current sizes; if size becomes a concern that's a future-friendly migration path.

### `dry_run`

`workflow_dispatch` accepts a `dry_run` input (default `true`). When true, the conditional `if:` on `github-release` and on the `openvsx-publish` publish steps evaluates false, so the pipeline builds + smoke-tests every binary, packages the `.vsix`, and uploads the artifact without publishing anything. Tag pushes always set `dry_run` effectively to false because the `if:` short-circuits on `github.event_name == 'push'`.

## Troubleshooting

### `verify` fails

The error message identifies which two of (workspace, extension, tag) disagree. Edit the offending file, re-tag if the tag was the wrong one (`git tag -d v0.x.0 && git push --delete origin v0.x.0` then re-tag).

### A `build-*` job fails

Look at the failing matrix entry. Most failures are a transient toolchain issue or a clippy/test regression — fix the underlying issue on `main`, push a new commit, and re-tag.

### `openvsx-publish` fails

- **`OVSX_PAT secret is unset`** — the pre-flight check ran. Set the secret per the one-time setup steps and re-run the failed job.
- **`401 Unauthorized` from `ovsx publish`** — the token expired, was revoked, or was generated against a different Eclipse account. Generate a fresh token at https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens and `gh secret set OVSX_PAT`.
- **`Namespace 'YashBhalodi' does not exist`** — the namespace pre-claim was never run, or it was claimed under a different account. Run `npx --yes ovsx create-namespace YashBhalodi --pat <token>` once with the same token now stored in `OVSX_PAT`.
- **Secret-scanner rejection on upload** — Open VSX runs an automated scan and refuses uploads it flags. The error message identifies the offending file inside the `.vsix`. Fix at the source (typically a stray `.env`, key, or test fixture that landed in the bundled extension), bump and re-tag.
- **`Extension YashBhalodi.kul <version> already exists`** — `ovsx publish` is not idempotent on a published version. Bump the workspace version (and `editor/vscode/package.json`), re-tag, and re-run the pipeline.

### `wasm-publish` fails on the npm publish step

- **`NPM_TOKEN secret is unset`** — the pre-flight check ran. Set the secret per the one-time npm setup steps and re-run the failed job.
- **`E401`/`E403` from `npm publish`** — the token expired, was revoked, or lacks publish permission on the `@kullang` scope. Generate a fresh automation token at npmjs.com (Account → Access Tokens → Automation) and `gh secret set NPM_TOKEN`.
- **`E403 — cannot publish over existing version`** — the version was already published. `npm publish` is not idempotent; bump the workspace version (and `editor/vscode/package.json`), re-tag, and re-run the pipeline.
- **`E402 — payment required` on first publish** — the `@kullang` scope is private-by-default. The job already passes `--access public`; if this surfaces, the scope-claim setup wasn't completed (see issue #36's one-time npm setup section).

### Release exists but extension didn't publish

`github-release` depends on `openvsx-publish`, so an Open VSX publish failure blocks the Release from being created in the first place. If the OVSX failure was transient (network blip, registry hiccup), fix any underlying issue and re-run the failed jobs (Actions UI → workflow run → "Re-run failed jobs"); the `kul-vsix` artifact uploaded earlier in the same job is reused. If Open VSX already accepted that version but the re-run mistakes it for a fresh attempt, you'll need to bump and re-cut — `ovsx publish` is not idempotent on the same version.

### Need to ship a fix

The semver-bump-and-tag procedure is the only path forward. There's no concept of "amending" a published release — bump to the next patch (or revert with a higher version if the broken release is in users' hands).
