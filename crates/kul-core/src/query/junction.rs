//! The **sibling junction** (apex) — the load-bearing concept of the
//! collateral slice (issue #257).
//!
//! In a single-blood-segment `up* down*` path, the **apex** is the person
//! where ascent turns to descent. The junction is the triple *(apex,
//! egoChild, alterChild)*: *egoChild* is the person on the path immediately
//! before the apex (the one the last `up` hop ascended from — for siblings
//! this is ego itself); *alterChild* is the person immediately after the apex
//! (the one the first `down` hop descended to — for siblings this is alter
//! itself). egoChild and alterChild are the two **branch siblings**; the
//! no-backtracking rule (ADR-0025) guarantees they are distinct.
//!
//! Two dimensions are derived here, both defined only at a sibling junction:
//! - [`Sharing`] — a **per-edge-kind** parent-set comparison of the branch
//!   siblings (bio set vs bio set; adoptive set vs adoptive set).
//! - the **couple apex** — whether the branch siblings share the *same two
//!   parents* (identical bio-parent sets of size 2, or both adopted by the
//!   same couple). A couple apex is *one relationship fact* even though the
//!   backbone could route through either co-parent, so the engine
//!   canonicalizes it through the smaller-id co-parent and emits one
//!   descriptor. It also drives `side = both`.
//!
//! This module owns the junction computation shared by the descriptor
//! (which reads `sharing` / the couple flag) and the traversal engine (which
//! canonicalizes the couple-apex backbone before de-duplicating).
